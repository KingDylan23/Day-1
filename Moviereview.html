            <p>A Working Man delivers what fans expect from Jason Statham:relentless fight sequences and a plot that marches briskly through family territory.Directed by David Ayer and co-written by Sylvester Stallion.Statham is placed in the role of Levon, ex-royal Marine turned construction worker,who pulled back into violence when his employer's daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers. </p>

            <h3>Action & Performance</h3>
            <p>Statham is in his element,dispatching villains with his signature blend of grit and efficiency.The action scenes are well-choreographed and explosive. While the movie is violent and light on narrative innovation,Statham's physicality and presence keep things engaging, even when the script leans on cliches.</p>

            <h3>Story & Characters</h3>
            <p>The plot centres on Levon's quest to rescue the kidnapped Jenny Garcia(Arinna Rivas)-follows a well-worn path, reiniscent of films like Taken. The supporting cast,including Michael Pena, David Harbour, and Isla Gie,offer competent performances,but most characters outside of Statham's Levon are underdeveloped and serve mainly as plot devices.The emotional beats,particularly Levon's relationship with his daughter,add some heart,though these moments often feel secondary to the film's main focus: action.</p>

            <h3>Tone & Direction</h3>
            <p>David Ayer's direction brings a hard-edge,late 90's action vibe with straight forward approach that rarely surprises but raely baores.The film's pacing is brisk,and while some critics found the story rote and villains cartoonish,the movie doesn't pretend to be more than a crowd pleasing,dad-moivie throwback.There is certain guilty-pleasure charm in watching Statham single handedly dismantle a criminal enterprise,even if the formula is overly familiar.</p>

            <h3>Final Verdict</h3>
            <p>A Working Man isn't groundbreaking, but it's a solid, entertaining ride for action fans and Statham devotees. If you're looking for depth or originality, you may be disappointed, but if you want to see Statham do what he does best-take down bad guys with style-it's worth a watch.I would give it a 3 out of 5</p>
